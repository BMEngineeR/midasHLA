\title{Stepwise conditional variables selection}
\usage{
forwardConditionalSelection(object, variables, th, keep = FALSE,
  rss_th = 1e-07)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An existing fit from a model function such as lm, glm and many
others.}

\item{variables}{Character specifying variables to use in selection
procedure.}

\item{th}{number specifying p-value threshold for a term to be included into
model.}

\item{keep}{logical flag indicating if the output should be a list of models
resulting from each selection step. Default is to return only the final
model.}

\item{rss_th}{number specifying residual sum of squares threshold at which
  function should stop adding additional terms.

As the residual sum of squares approaches \code{0} the perfect fit is
obtained making further attempts at model selection nonsense, thus function
is stopped. This behavior can be controlled using \code{rss_th}.}
}
\value{
selected model or list of models. See \code{keep} parameter.
}
\description{
\code{stepwiseConditionalSelection} performs stepwise conditional testing
adding the previous top-associated variable as covariate, until thereâ€™s no
more significant variables based on a self-defined threshold.
}
\details{
Selection criteria is the p-value from the test on coefficients values.
