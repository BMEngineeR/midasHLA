# Meaningful Immunogenetic Data at Scale <img src="vignettes/MiDAS_logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

Human immunogenetic variation in the form of HLA and KIR 
types has been shown to be strongly associated with a 
multitude of immune-related phenotypes. We present MiDAS, 
an R package enabling statistical association analysis and 
using immunogenetic data transformation functions for HLA 
amino acid fine mapping, analysis of HLA evolutionary 
divergence as well as HLA-KIR interactions. MiDAS closes the 
gap between inference of immunogenetic variation and its 
efficient utilization to make meaningful discoveries.
