# Meaningful Immunogenetic Data at Scale
Human immunogenetic variation in the form of HLA and KIR 
types has been shown to be strongly associated with a 
multitude of immune-related phenotypes. We present MiDAS, 
an R package enabling statistical association analysis and 
using immunogenetic data transformation functions for HLA 
amino acid fine mapping, analysis of HLA evolutionary 
divergence as well as HLA-KIR interactions. MiDAS closes the 
gap between inference of immunogenetic variation and its 
efficient utilization to make meaningful discoveries.

The package can be installed from github using `devtools`

`devtools::install_github("Genentech/MiDAS", build_vignettes = TRUE)`
